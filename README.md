Morphing Sounds Easy – Until You Have to Define It Precisely
Morphing in CAE often looks simple from the outside — just “stretch” or “shift” the geometry, right?
But in practice, precision in setup makes the difference between a clean, usable mesh and a distorted, solver-breaking model.

In my current crash simulation project, I’m morphing the front crash bar / bumper reinforcement / metal crash beam.
Sounds straightforward — but to make it work properly, the morphing setup had to be clear, logical, and rule-based.

# Complexity of Setup: Precision is Crucial
Morphing only works well when the software fully understands your intent:

Control entities – what is allowed to move (edges, surfaces, nodes)

Constraint entities – what must stay fixed (boundaries, interfaces)

Direction or path – how the deformation should be applied

Guide paths / follower constraints – for curved or organic shapes

Morphing parameters (design variables) – for parametric studies

🛠️ Without these definitions, morphing can cause:

Unwanted mesh distortion

Poor element quality

Interference with connected parts

It’s not just “dragging a line” — it’s about giving the solver rules it can trust.

# Where Box Morphing Comes In
When direct morphing is too rough or uncontrolled, Box Morphing (in ANSA) or Morphing Volume (in HyperMesh) is a better choice.
This approach surrounds your geometry in a control box, where selected faces or edges act as morph handles.

This makes it much easier to:

Define deformation directions precisely

Apply smooth, uniform shape changes

Preserve mesh quality in sensitive regions

Link morphing to parametric design variables for optimization

In my bumper case, box morphing allowed me to adjust the crash beam geometry without breaking mesh continuity or altering fixed connection areas.

📌 In my upcoming post, I’ll share the before/after results of this study and the impact on crash simulation performance.
