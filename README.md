# Morphing

combine FVSS201 and FMVSS226 in 1 Task
xog FMVSS226
problem:
1. 1 shell part has identical nodes, duplicated elements--> must choose both node in morphing-- the 2 identical nodes won't lie in the same location after morphing
2. symmetric-->
3. multi simulation morphing
4. 
5. 
# Morphing Multiple Parts = Higher Risk of Geometry Conflicts
(Challenge: Intersections & Collisions in Morphed Variants)

When one design variable controls multiple components, morphing becomes powerful — but also fragile.

In my case, changing the height of the car front window isn’t just about one surface.
It also affects related parts like:

Pillars

Roof rail

Inner trims

Headliner

✅ All of them were included in the morphing setup under the same design variable.

Idea: Window 1 design variable breit--> apillar-- affect AP2 FMVSS201u 
2 DV of Apillar: bea. distannce, wide..
